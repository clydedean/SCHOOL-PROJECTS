                <h3>Why is encryption important? (value and usage of encryption)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> Encryption is crucial for protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in digital communications and storage. For example, it secures online transactions, protects personal information, and safeguards intellectual property.

                <h3>Can encryption be misused? (scenarios)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, encryption can be misused in various scenarios. It can be used to hide illegal activities, such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and child pornography. It can also be used to protect malware and ransomware from detection.

                <h3>Discussion on real-life ethical concerns about encryption. (from various sources and do not forget to cite the source of the information)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> Ethical concerns arise in cases like law enforcement access to encrypted data. Balancing national security with individual privacy is a significant challenge. For instance, the debate over "backdoors" in encryption systems highlights this tension. Additionally, the use of encryption by whistleblowers and journalists to protect sensitive information raises ethical questions about transparency and accountability.
